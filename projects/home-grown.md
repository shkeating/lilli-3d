  home grown was a solo exhibition that concluded a year-long Ceramics Artist
  Residency at Brockway Center for Arts and Technology.


  My bedroom has always been a place of the upmost comfort and privacy. The
  furnishings often moved with me as I started over in each new bedroom, house,
  town, or state; they became the only consistencies in times of change. Like a
  silent supportive friend, they held me during times of happiness and distress.
  However, through mundane daily interactions, these familiar objects often fade
  into the background. In applying the pink glaze that coats the dioramas, I
  acknowledge my clouded memory of the furniture and rooms. As I recreate
  beloved furniture from my past and present, I am taking time to remember them
  and, in the process, bringing them into the spotlight. In this way, home grown
  is meant to glorify these pieces that have mattered to me and reflect on the
  experiences and memories that surround them.
