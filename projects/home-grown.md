  home grown was a solo exhibition that concluded a year-long Ceramics Artist
  Residency at Brockway Center for Arts and Technology.


  My bedroom has always been a place of the upmost comfort and privacy. The
  furnishings often moved with me as I started over in each new bedroom, house,
  town, or state; they became the only consistencies in times of change. Like a
  silent supportive friend, they held me during times of happiness and distress.


  As I recreate beloved furniture from my past and present, I am taking time to
  remember them and, in the process, bringing them into the spotlight. In this
  way, home grown is meant to glorify these pieces that have mattered to me and
  reflect on the experiences and memories that surround them.

      However, through mundane daily interactions, these familiar objects often
      fade into the background. In applying the pink glaze that coats the
      dioramas, I acknowledge my clouded memory of the furniture and rooms.
