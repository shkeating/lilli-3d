title: welcome home
description: >
  Control of the distinct physical experiences of comfort and discomfort often
  comes from objects rather than ourselves. I remember being at a concert and
  needing to use the bathroom the whole time, and it ruined the entire
  experience. Certain objects control this comfort, yet they arenâ€™t the objects
  we appreciate in reference to our well-being. Once they are unavailable, their
  absence is immediately noticeable. By shifting scale, texture, and color, I
  force these unnoticed objects to become a spectacle. This recontextualizes
  them into a strange, yet almost familiar, still-life setting.


  Welcome Home! was my thesis exhibition at SUNY New Paltz, receiving my
  Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics.
