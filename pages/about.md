## about the artist

Lillian Helling is a ceramic artist specializing in hand-built sculptural work. She holds a BFA in Ceramics from SUNY New Paltz, which she completed in 2018. Since then, Lilli has further cultivated her understanding of the medium through her work as a studio technician throughout the northeast including a significant residency at Brockway Center for Arts and Technology, culminating in her exhibition of her body of work titled home grown. These diverse experiences, from facilitating studio environments to dedicated artistic exploration, enrich her ability to transform personal reflections into resonant sculptural narratives.
